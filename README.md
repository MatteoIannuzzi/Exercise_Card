# Exercise_Card
This project shows a simple web page that displays three music album cards, each with its own cover and title.
The layout is responsive and modern thanks to the use of Flexbox and a custom CSS style.

Included files
index_1_Card.html
Contains the HTML structure of the page, with three cards showing the album images and names.

styles_1_Card.css
Manages the style of the page: sets the card layout, image size, background colors, and adds a zoom effect when the mouse hovers over the cards.

Usage
Open index_1_Card.html in a browser to see the album gallery with the stylized cards.
You can edit images and titles to adapt the page to your favorite albums.
